add unique constraint to username


Create database
	Learn about fuctions + views
	Figure out how to find low/fast selling items
	Design class requirements
		Use info under "Create all Linq-Sql classes" + "General issues"
	Build Db
	
	Figure out inheritance with Sql-linq class (e.g. Admin : User, Staff : User)
		and User is defined in Sql-linq class	

FEATURES TO WORK ON
Return delivery/item data
Allow editing of delivery/item data
Graph of revenue over-time
Accounts - Need single table inheritance (linq) for staffAccount and adminAccount
Login
Admin account can create new StaffAccount, give it all permission and name and password
	when this StaffAccount first logins in, give option to change password

Create all Linq-Sql classes
		Setup factory class for LoginService
		store current user 
		store current GblValues

	Make method to create new GblValues object
		It takes values from DB
		Combine into one constructor method
		Refactor code
		Throw exceptions for GetGblValues
		Needs a finalizer if not destroyed automatically
	
	Make method to logout current user
		create logoutUI
			create UI page for login
			create login()
				using MVVM to change values where possible
		then login in new user 
			Check password + username + get userID from database
		
			User can create new CurrentDelivery
				Get new currentDelivery method working
				Get new currentDelivery to create new records in Item_CurrentDelivery table
		
			User can create new PastDelivery
				Should inherit delivery class + add expectedArrival date + something else
				Should have a createPastDelivery too

UI

General issues
	GitHub repo for project
	Create thread for .BL and one for .UI and one for database processes (?)
	Have a set values method
		For current GblValues object
