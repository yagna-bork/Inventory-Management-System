# What can it do?
## Provides separate admin and staff accounts
This so only admin can view important store performance metrics like total sales, that you wouldn't want staff to be seeing

As an admin you can make a new, restricted, employee account as you please!

The best part is that you can choose what exactly an employee account can do from a list of:
* Adding deliveries
* Editing database tables (i.e. changing prices or names)
* Analytics
