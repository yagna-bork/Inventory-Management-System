# What can it do?
## Features that my client found the most useful

> The most useful custom made feature for me was the list of products that will sell out soon.
> I also liked having the ability to see when item's run out of stock on the day they do
> That way in the morning before I open my store I can scroll through the list and get rid of items
> if it need to.

## Provides separate admin and staff accounts
This so only admin can view important store performance metrics like total sales, that you wouldn't want staff to be seeing

As an admin you can make a new, restricted, employee account as you please!

The best part is that you can choose what exactly an employee account can do from a list of:
* Adding deliveries
* Editing database tables (i.e. changing prices or names)
* Analytics
